Patient: That's right. Oh, man. My asthma has been getting worse over the last three months. My allergies are also acting up again. 
Doctor: Oh, no. Has anything changed that may have made your allergies worse? 
Patient: Well, my husband has been hauling more corn in since it's busy season. I think that might have made it worse. 
Doctor: Are you taking any medications to alleviate your asthma and allergies? 
Patient: I'm using my inhaler every day for my asthma. Here are the other medications and treatments I've been using. I know I wouldn't have remembered, so I put them on a paper for you to see.

","Doctor: Hello, ma'am. What is the reason for your visit today? 
Patient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you. 
Doctor: Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? 
Patient:  Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? 
Doctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. 
Patient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me. 
Doctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago? 
Patient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat.
Doctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? 
Patient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. 
Doctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? 
Patient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? 
Doctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. 
Patient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. 
Doctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? 
Patient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. 
Doctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? 
Patient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. 
Doctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. 
Patient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. 
Doctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? 
Patient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! 
Doctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? 
Patient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. 
Doctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. 
Patient: Sounds good. 
Doctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. 
Patient: That's reassuring. 
Doctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  
Patient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. 
Doctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?
Patient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. 
Doctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? 
Patient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. 
Doctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? 
Patient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. 
Doctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? 
Patient: Yeah, I did. 
Doctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. 
Patient: Sounds good. 
Doctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right.

Guest_family: What is that?
Doctor: It's a small procedure, minimally invasive, and we can do it outpatient. Her kneecap is partially dislocating, so this surgery will get everything back into alignment.

Guest_family: We noticed it the week prior to Thanksgiving last year in nineteen ninety four. We have a family tradition where we play a game and this time, we were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play ""Murder She Wrote"" at one of our family gatherings. She was chosen to be the assassin. 
Doctor: Okay. 
Guest_family: Kids played a trick with her and they hid a plastic gun, a toy gun in her luggage. As she walked through the security, the alarm went off and like within seconds she was all surrounded, and everyone was like panicked. There was so much panic, they searched her and interrogated her and what not. Eventually she and her family made it to the flight, and she seemed unusually frustrated and disoriented by all that. Previously, if any such incident would have happened in the past, she would just have like chuckled and brushed it off. And we all would have sat together and laughed about it. This time it was different. 
Doctor: I can see why she was frustrated. Anyone can be in such situations. 
Guest_family: When we were in Colorado, she seemed slow. She had difficulty reading her lines to her part when we were playing that game. She needed assistance to complete the whole game. 
Doctor: Was she slurring?
Guest_family: Nope. 
Doctor: Was there any difficulty with vision? Or any weakness? 
Guest_family: Nope. Nothing that we noticed. 
Doctor: How was it after returning from there?

Patient:  I was not able to take on with my usual task of flower arrangements or dealing with the cash at the cash register. 
Guest_family: She quit the next day, and she never went back. 
Doctor: How was it after that? 
Guest_family: She seemed to be doing fine and stable throughout November and December, and we were visiting a local neurologist as well, who was evaluating her. He did a few blood tests and did uh, M R I of the brain. He gave us all clear. He said there's nothing there. 
Doctor: Yeah, I see the working diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's Type. When did these symptoms increase? Like when did you started noticing them more? 
Guest_family: One or two weeks ago, so end of December nineteen ninety four, she got lost in her own home. She was getting more sensitive and started saying that she is becoming a liability for everyone, which is not at all like her. Her walking was affected. She started walking like a bended form and also started veering to the right. She also did not recognize the location of where people were talking to her."

Guest_family: What does that mean, doctor? 
Doctor: Well, he's broken his leg, and pulled some bone off by doing so. We'll need to do surgery on this.
Guest_family: Oh no, what's the name of the procedure? 
Doctor: It's called an O R I F. We'll go in there with some hardware to put everything back together, and he can get on the road to healing. 
Guest_family: Let me call his father while we discuss this. What's the risk of infection from this surgery? 
Doctor: Historically, it's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. 
Guest_family: Okay, will he be asleep for this? 
Doctor: Yes, he won't feel a thing.
Guest_family: That's good too. Will he need this hardware out in the future?
Doctor: We can remove everything once he has healed up nicely. Other risks include bleeding, changes in the sensation of the leg, hardware failure, need for post op rehab, need for hardware removal, and failure to restore extensor mechanism tension. But I would not worry about these things. I have been doing these surgeries for years and things like this rarely happen.

Patient: Okay, you're right. What are the risks of this infection with this surgery?

Patient: Hm. 
Doctor: I see that you have already been given some I V fluid along with antibiotics by the emergency room doctor. 
Guest_family: Yeah. 
Doctor: Did he ever complain of pain during urination or nausea and vomiting?
Guest_family: Yes, he had fever a few days back. When we asked him about other symptoms, he said, it's hard to urinate and it is painful. Nausea and vomiting are something that I am not sure about. He was normally rushing to the restroom and every time used to say he didn't want to pee as it hurt him. He also had a few accidents in the last few days where he wet himself.

Patient: Its been several months at this point, and honestly no, there's been no improvement. I'm still in a lot of pain.  
Doctor: This C T Scan you had recently shows sclerosis, with some healing of a L five compression fracture, but if you look here, the healing is not complete. 
Patient: What can we do about this? I'm in so much pain. 
Doctor: I believe you'd be a candidate for a bilateral L five kyphoplasty. 
Patient: What's that? 
Doctor: It's a small procedure on that L five vertebra. Its minimally invasive, and we can actually do it as an outpatient procedure. 
Patient: Oh, wow, that's good to hear. What are the risks of infection?
Doctor: Very low, historically, they're less than one percent. 
Patient: How is this possible? 
Doctor: We'll use antibiotics in order to control for infection. 
Patient: That's great, will I be under anesthesia?
Doctor: Yes, you'll be asleep for the whole thing. 
Patient: Great, yes, I'd like to have this done, I can't keep living in this pain.

Patient: I'm twenty five years old. 
Doctor: Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?
Doctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific. 
Doctor: What kind of procedures were done to address it? 
Doctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss?
Patient: Yeah, that's correct. 
Doctor: Were there any findings, Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.
Doctor: I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture? 
Doctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am? 
Patient: That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right.
Doctor: Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions? 
Doctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw. 
Doctor: Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct? 
Patient: Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked. 
Doctor_2: I remember that. I was here when she presented the rash. We suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis. 
Doctor: Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests? 
Doctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased. 
Doctor: Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found? 
Doctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit. 
Doctor: Could you explain what it says?
Doctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis. 
Doctor: The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right? 
Doctor_2: That is correct. 
Doctor: Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that? 
Doctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative. 
Doctor: What lupus serologies were used? 
Doctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used. 
Doctor: How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look? 
Doctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten. 
Doctor: I see. Was there anything else in the report? 
Doctor_2: She had her beta 2 glycoprotein one or R V V T tested. 
Doctor: That seems important because of the livedo pattern. 
Doctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum. 
Doctor: Why did she undergo a C T scan?
Doctor_2: We feared she had lymphoma. The scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to rule out sarcoid. 
Doctor: I see. The results came out normal, right?
Doctor_2: That's correct. 
Doctor: Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am? 
Patient: I tried my best to. 
Doctor: That's good. What was found Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V.
Doctor: That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?
Doctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report. 
Doctor: Were there any tests done to confirm this? 
Doctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically. 
Doctor: Nothing was seen microscopically? 
Doctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils. 
Doctor: That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance. 
Patient: Could I interrupt for a second? I don't think my B twelve and iron deficiency were looked at while I stayed in the United States. 
Doctor: Is that correct, Doctor X?
Doctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else. 
Doctor: At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit? 
Doctor_2: It looks like she was placed on forty milligrams of prednisone. The strength was reduced over time. 
Doctor: This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication?
Doctor_2: Yes, she was. There were too many adverse effects. 
Doctor: What was she places on after?
Doctor_2: It looks like she started a point six m g colchicine, which she took daily. 
Doctor: How were her inflammatory markers after taking it? 
Doctor_2: Her markers were under control and positive. She also didn't have any evidence of erythema nodosum. 
Doctor: That is great. How did you like that medication, ma'am? 
Patient: My ankle would swell up and hurt. There were also some sensitive rashes on the skin of my legs. 
Doctor: I see. Is that stated on the report, Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: It is. I also see that she was reevaluated by Dermatology. 
Doctor: Did they find anything apparent? 
Doctor_2: No, they didn't. They didn't find any evidence of erythema nodosum. 
Doctor: What was the plan following that? 
Docotr_2: It looks like we proceeded with a D E X A scan and checked her vitamin D levels. 
Doctor: Was there any medication prescribed? 
Doctor_2: We ordered vitamin D and calcium to be bought over the counter so that her bones were protected. However, they use of them was stopped until we figured out the underlying cause of her disease. 
Doctor: I see. Other than the fracture and jaw surgery, was there anything else? 
Doctor_2: It shows she had Varicella and Mononucleosis, correct ma'am? 
Patient: Yeah, that's correct. 
Doctor: That's good. Our recent physical exam with you from last August showed changes in your venous stasis and diffuse periarticular ankle edema. Fortunately, we did not find any erythema nodosum, but the livedo patter was still present. 
Patient: I see. Did you find anything else? 
Doctor: We did find a heart murmur, so we will conduct an echocardiogram. Doctor X, could you confirm all the details form the workup, please?
Doctor_2: Of course. Her A C E levels were normal. Her sed rate was around 30, which was high. Before that, it was around one ten, which is even higher. Her R V V T was normal. The rheumatoid factor was negative. The urinalysis was also normal. She had a C R P level of two point three, which was high. Her C C P came out negative. Her C B C displayed microcytosis and hypochromia with hematocrit levels of thirty seven point seven. Her hematocrit levels improved to forty point three later on, and she did not have any hypochromia, microcytosis, or anemia present. 
Doctor: Thank you for all that information. Does all this information and history seem to be correct, ma'am? 
Patient: Yes. Thank you for going over that in front of me. 
Doctor: No problem. I see you're here today regarding some mild but intense skin rashes. You mentioned that you thought it was erythema nodosum, correct? 
Patient: Yeah, that's correct. I think it's on my ankles. I also feel some joint stiffness. 
Doctor: I will take note of that. You also mentioned something about a rash before. Did you have a rash that was sensitive to U V light, like sunlight? 
Patient: That's right. I had it twice when I was in Europe. 
Doctor: When did you notice the rashes? 
Patient: I was skiing, and my face started to swell up. 
Doctor: I see. Do you think it had to do anything with your acne? 
Patient: No. My acne was stable after I stopped taking that one medicine and started the other. 
Doctor: The prednisone and colchicine we mentioned earlier, correct? 
Patient: That's correct. 
Doctor: Is there anything else you would like to ask? 
Patient: I am trying to get pregnant and would like to know if the medication has any effects on pregnancy.
